## Hypothesis

When the world is faced with fear and panic, certain items will unexpectedly become household necessities

## Questions
### How does spending correlate to a pandemic?
During the pandemic panic of 2020, we saw a massive increase in non durable goods purchased in April, and then a large drop in May, as stock ran out or people didn't need to restock their stash of items yet.
Grocery item sales generally stayed above the 2019 sales as people were purchasing more to use and do at home due to quarantine. We also saw recreational spending related to home related products rise in May & June. People were getting used to being home, and looking for ways to improve their entertainment, recreation, productivity, and general environment. Plus, the stimulus check inspired many people to purchase for fun instead of just necessity.
The pandemic also lead to less travel, so gasoline sales dropped significantly and have yet to recover.
