## Hypothesis

When the world is faced with fear and panic, certain items will unexpectedly become household necessities

## Questions

### How does spending correlate to a pandemic?
* We saw a massive increase in non durable goods purchased in April, and then a large drop in May, as stock ran out or people didn't need to restock yet. Grocery item sales generally stayed above the 2019 sales as people were purchasing more to use and do at home due to quarantine.

* We also saw recreational spending related to home related products rise in May & June. People were getting used to being home, and looking for ways to improve their entertainment, recreation, productivity, and general environment. Plus, the stimulus check inspired many people to purchase for fun instead of just necessity.

* The pandemic also lead to less travel, so gasoline sales dropped significantly and have yet to recover.

### What trends were expected vs unexpected?
* We expected grocery spending to spike in April, as it did, and we also expected alcohol sales to spike and stay high. Alcohol tends to stay constant during times of turmoil, and at home sales did especially well since people couldn't go out during quarantine.

* Unexpected trends we saw were the decline in sugary drinks and snacks compared to 2019. We theorize this was due to the health trends people jumped on at the start of quarantine.

* We also didn't expect to see recreational and other durable items rise in May & June, although it makes sense when you frame it with the release of the stimulus.

* Meat sales took a dive below 2019 sales in June, which was a surprise. Upon researching, we found there were COVID outbreaks at multiple meat packing plants, which lead to less supply and restricted purchasing in June.

### Does spending change after a 'new normal' is established?
* As quarantine continued, spending definitely changed. We saw a rise in home improvement related purchases, recreational purchases more related to home and outdoor activities, and productivity related items, like computers.

### If we are faced with a second wave of COVID, how should you prepare?
Based on our data, our recommendations for a second wave are as follows:
* If able, stock up early on necessities. You want to try to purchase before the initial panic spike purchases happen. Things like toilet paper, cleaning supplies, and groceries would be good to have a stockpile of as it could become difficult to purchase even just for regular day use.
* Be prepared to be flexible with purchases. COVID has effected the production of multiple products, so be prepared for shortages, increases in price, and purchase limits.
* Think ahead for items you may need if quarantine continues for very long. Items for working from home and recreation are good to grab early as we did see outtages and increased delivery times of some of these products a month or two into quarantine.
