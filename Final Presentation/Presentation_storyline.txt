What items are necessary for survival when people are faced with uncertainty, fear and panic? 

Initially we saw a spike in the below as people were getting prepared for lockdown for an unknown time:
	TP shortage, bleach, cleaners - initial spike and then flat lined because how much extra products do you need?
	Alcohol, coffee - spike and increase here to stay - working from home, not going out to bars etc…coping mechanism
	Sweets, soda/juice  - but then spending dropped even dipping lower than PY …. Maybe showing people caring more about their health/fitness after the first couple 	months of quarantine
	

As the world moved into a new-normal (post April/May) what trends did we see?
	Recreational and gardening increase
		- people spending more time outside, new way to stay active and socialize
		- people at home, working on home projects
		- product of govt stimulus check
		- people aren’t spending their money traveling so investing in more recreational activities

Because there wasn’t an initial spike in the above categories but post new normal world, spending on these categories are consistently increasing…this suggests the value of these items are increasing making them a good item to keep on hand as traceable or barter able if needed
	ex: paddle boards, bikes

Interesting trends we didn’t expect:
	- meat shortage due to factory covid outbreaks
	-data used was already adjusted for inflation, but we can see nondurable spending is consistently up YOY pointing to the fact that people are staying at home and cooking for themselves much more
		-confirmed by spending trends in durable goods being inconsistent YOY

Conclusions: 
People cope with panic by drinking and eating more. TP and irregular items such as household cleaning supplies become scarcities. As people adapt to a new world, spending increases in unexpected areas due to people finding new ways to thrive. - Recreational goods and gardening supplies become the new bartering currency.
